Scripts, commands, and text to help (remembering) my daily work.

== Commands

=== chj - Change Java Version
Simple and fast command to change between java versions in the console.
Follow the jdk version numbering; 1.7, 1.8, 9, 10, 11 and so on.
You need the source modifier if you want to make it permanent for the current console, or else it will only change for the commands executed on the same line.
